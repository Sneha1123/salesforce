SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol

Apex Methods can be exposed to External systems as SOAP webservices.
Apex uses Apex Callouts for interacting with external application.
Apex callouts allows apex to invoke external systems through HTTP.

Rules to be followed:
  1. Webservice keyword cannot be used with
    Class
    Interface
    Triggers
    
  2. Webservice keyword should be used when exposing
    Methods - static should be used
    Variables
    
  3. If inner class is global then outer class should be global
  //consider webservice as access specifier withh accessibilty more than global
